# OpenCart
A test project for OpenCart:

This Maven project contains test cases using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.
The cases test a positive login scenario, some negative login scenarios and add to cart tests.
There are identical tests written using Cucumber-JVM.
To run the tests, simply download the project and import it to Intellij as an existing project, 
make sure to change the path to the ChromeDriver as well as the image upload path in the AddAppleCinemaToCart
test, and type "mvn test" in the terminal.
